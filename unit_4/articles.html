		<h1>Hip To Be Square (Becoming A Google Square)</h1>
		<br>
		<p>First things first.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you've landed here in the hope of unearthing some useful nuggets in how to sail through Google's Squared Online course, which I've just graduated from, with additional ease and higher grades then soz/apols etc. I know it's 2015 and mastering the art of Search is as useful a skill as any you could possibly acquire in modern life but no. Do the bloody work yourself. Go on the journey. Embrace the gaps in your digital knowledge. Lord knows I had to.</p>
		<br>
		<p>What is Squared Online? Well it's the learning by doing, global, remote, online Digital Marketing (I hate to say course because you'll think note taking, revision, exams, but I can't quite pluck a better word out of my head for now) so I guess yes course.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I've typically filled 2/3 lever arch files with increasingly illegible notes on previous courses. Beautifully spaced and bulleted prose in Module One, a complete disregard for lines/margins/gravity and something somewhere between Arabic and morse code at the end, even though I understand neither. The notes I took over these last 7 months or so for Squared amount to less than the list of ingredients for my famous ginger chicken stir fry (I can give you the recipe at the end if you like?).</p>
		<br>
		<p>And I'm quite sure that, head buried in aforementioned lever arch files, I've elbowed more than my fair share of commuters into the path of a 205 bus at Kings Cross or under the driver's carriage of a newly air-conditioned Metropolitan Line tube at Finchley Road as I shuffled blindly (and deafly) back and forth to the office each day trying to get my brain around "structured citations" and "purchase funnels". The 2014 suicide rates in London would probably look a lot less alarming if you filtered out those coming to an early demise purely as a result of my exam revision.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The streets (and platforms) however have been a hell of a lot safer thankfully these last 7 months as, well, there are no Squared Online exams. And hence no revision. But don't be fooled into thinking this all equates to no work.</p>
		<br>
		<p>HA!</p>
		<br>
		<p>This is project work. This is team work. This is hard work.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I quite fancy General Assembly's Digital Marketing course. I really like the idea of coming away at the end with a single completed project. Something that can be presented to prospective employers, or your current employer, as demonstration of practical application of all your new abilities and learning applied to a real scenario. Alternatively, Squared Online focuses on your ability, or failure, to engage with a globally dispersed bunch of strangers, and for you and that bunch of strangers to organise themselves effectively enough to deliver maybe a new digitally disruptive business pitch, or an integrated marketing campaign for a brand launch, or a detailed white paper on an industry you possibly know nothing about. By next Tuesday. Or everyone fails.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Essentially: here's some email addresses of people around the world you don't know, and might not even like. See you in a fortnight. Bye!</p>
		<br>
		<p>Of course, there are live online classes and pre and post class "activities", but these are all designed to flesh out your understanding of elements of whichever project you're currently involved in, of which you will undertake 6 in total, 5 in your functional or dysfunctional groups (I've previously written about the terror of the one solo project in case you haven't revelled in it already - alternatively you can experience mine without all the accompanying excuses on youtube).</p>
		<br>
		<p>The classes, with everyone encouraged to have a voice of their own and not parrot the thoughts of others, are often irreverent and at times mutinous. And that's just the tutors. Aiden Carroll was particularly exceptional (and particularly irreverent), opening with guilty dancefloor pleasures and rushing us thirstily to to summing up and questions when he could see a chilled glass of Riesling in sight.</p>
		<br>
		<p>(There are some fantastic guest expert speakers too btw, and a load of essential additional video resources from a number of marketing gurus).</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you've done a live online class before you'll know how this works: pretty pictures and graphs appear on the right, on the left is an unmoderated free for all chat box, "multiple attendees are typing!", which suddenly becomes moderated when the tutor needs a lie down, or a paracetamol, or both. This is the online equivalent of everyone in class being sent off to stand in corners, facing the wall.</p>
		<br>
		<p>But the hard work, the more time consuming and energy sapping work, comes with the projects. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Communication is key. If you can work out an efficient way to hold group meetings with several time zones involved; if you can agree a forum for exchanging ideas, feedback, urgent messages between those group meetings; if you can find, and stick to, one great productivity tool that everyone understands how to use. Then you are on your way at least.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We used Google Hangouts, a video conferencing app, for meetings, and if at times it seemed like talking to 7 bad holiday shots (top of a bald head here, an oversized eye in complete darkness there) and listening to someone constantly tuning police radio, we managed fine and I was able to try out some visual tricks I use with my niece on FaceTime to some (i.e. little or no) hilarity.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I was very apprehensive at the beginning of this course. Here I was, with no real digital experience, wanting to show my credentials as a genuine future digital leader. It might have been "online" but unlike the other courses there was nowhere really to hide. But as the course developed, it became clear that digital business is still business and my good old fashioned commercial experience counted for more than I ever expected. And a brain is still a brain. Present me with a problem and I will try my best to understand it and deliver solutions. Most of all, you can never underestimate the skills required to motivate and drive a team towards a shared goal. Often all it requires is humour. Or a degree of calm. It can be the ability to listen. To empathise. To compromise. None of these are digital skills. But I think I have a few of them.</p>
		<br>
		<p>All in all I loved it. The knowledge I acquired, the tutors I learned from, the other students I worked hard with to get to the end in one piece. It gave me confidence that this journey, this career change, is absolutely the way forward. Always keep learning new things, but take with you everything you have learnt before.
		<br>
		<p>Together they're a wonderful thing.</p>
